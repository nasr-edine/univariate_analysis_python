# [Project 2] Participez à un concours sur la Smart City

This is the code repository for my first project in Data Science about Maintaining Urban Trees in Paris, published on December 01, 2022.

## Prerequisites

- Python interpreter, version 3.7 or higher

## Installation

clone repository locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nasr-edine/p2_univariate_analysis.git
```

Move to the p2_univariate_analysis root folder:

```bash
cd p2_univariate_analysis/
```

[set up a virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment).

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

[activate it](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#activating-a-virtual-environment)

```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

[install the packages listed in requirements.txt](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#using-requirements-files)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then launch JupyterLab and use the 1_prep_dataset.ipynb Jupyter notebook to check your setup.

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Consult [this resource](https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/jupyter-notebooks-best-practices-use-virtual-environments/) if you have issues with using your virtual environment in Jupyter.
